Most of you have probably been in several classes together, but I'm a brand new face! In the first class, I will briefly introduce myself, but we don't have enough time for in-class introductions for everyone. Thus, I'd like you to share some information with me.\n\n## Grading/Rubric\n\nGrading will be done using a scale from 0-5. We will use the following scale on **only this homework assignment**:\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped table-hover\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Grade </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Description </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 5 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> All problems completed </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 4 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 80-100% problems completed </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 3 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 60-80% problems completed </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 40-60% problems completed </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 20-40% problems completed </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 0-20% problems completed </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf you are stressed about time, please give yourself an extension. \n\n# Questions \n\n## Question 1\nPlease upload a picture of yourself to Slack.

You may also edit the written pronunciation of your name. This is optional. I realize that doing this is may require a lot of time researching phonetics. \n\n## Question 3 \nPlease complete the [following whenisgood poll](https://whenisgood.net/i7ixr57) so that we can schedule office hours. Please use a unique identifier (does not have to be your name), so that I can make sure each student can attend at least one office hour.\n\n## Question 4\nCompletion of this question is optional. If you are comfortable sharing your pronouns, please edit your name in Slack to include them. For example, I have changed my name to be \\\"Nicky Wakim (she/her)\\\". If you prefer to not share your pronouns, then I will refer to you using they/them pronouns. \n\n## Question 5\nPlease post an introduction in the #random channel. Your introduction may include information like:\n\n* Preferred name\n* Pronouns\n* Career interests\n* Hobbies\n* Family, children, and/or fur babies\n* Adventures\n* Willingness to join a study group\n* Big three astrology signs\n* Motivation for taking the course\n* Anticipated Spring trip/activity\n\nPlease feel free to get creative with what you share! You don't need to adhere to this list.\n\n## Question 6\nCompletion of this question is only necessary if you have accommodations. If you have any learning accommodations, please email me about your needs. I should receive a direct email from the Office of Student Access, but it is important that we discuss how accommodations will translate to our class. \n",
