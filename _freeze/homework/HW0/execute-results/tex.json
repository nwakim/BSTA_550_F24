Most of you have probably been in several classes together, but I'm a brand new face! In the first class, I will briefly introduce myself, but we don't have enough time for in-class introductions for everyone. Thus, I'd like you to share some information with me.\n\n## Grading/Rubric\n\nGrading will be done using a scale from 0-5. We will use the following scale on **only this homework assignment**:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begin{table}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{r|l}\n\\hline\nGrade & Description\\\\\n\\hline\n5 & All problems completed\\\\\n\\hline\n4 & 80-100% problems completed\\\\\n\\hline\n3 & 60-80% problems completed\\\\\n\\hline\n2 & 40-60% problems completed\\\\\n\\hline\n1 & 20-40% problems completed\\\\\n\\hline\n0 & 0-20% problems completed\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nIf you are stressed about time, please give yourself an extension. \n\n# Questions \n\n## Question 1\nPlease upload a picture of yourself to Slack. Please follow the below steps to add a picture of yourself in Slack:\n\n1. Go to the top right corner in Slack and click your profile picture.\n2. Click \\\"Profile.\\\"\n3. In the picture of the clip art person, click \\\"Upload Photo\\\" in top right corner. \n4. Upload a picture file of yourself.\n\n## Question 2\nProvide a pronunciation of your name: Please follow the below steps to add an audio and written pronunciation of your name in Slack:\n\n1. Go to the top right corner in Slack and click your profile picture.\n2. Click \\\"Profile.\\\"\n3. To the right of your name, click \\\"Edit.\\\"\n4. Under \\\"Name Recording,\\\" click \\\"Record Audio Clip.\\\"\n5. Please say your name once at a normal pace then once slowly. Please listen to my audio for an example. \n6. You may also edit the written pronunciation of your name. This is optional. I realize that doing this is may require a lot of time researching phonetics. \n\n## Question 3 \nPlease complete the [following whenisgood poll](https://whenisgood.net/i7ixr57) so that we can schedule office hours. Please use a unique identifier (does not have to be your name), so that I can make sure each student can attend at least one office hour.\n\n## Question 4\nCompletion of this question is optional. If you are comfortable sharing your pronouns, please edit your name in Slack to include them. For example, I have changed my name to be \\\"Nicky Wakim (she/her)\\\". If you prefer to not share your pronouns, then I will refer to you using they/them pronouns. \n\n## Question 5\nPlease post an introduction in the #random channel. Your introduction may include information like:\n\n* Preferred name\n* Pronouns\n* Career interests\n* Hobbies\n* Family, children, and/or fur babies\n* Adventures\n* Willingness to join a study group\n* Big three astrology signs\n* Motivation for taking the course\n* Anticipated Spring trip/activity\n\nPlease feel free to get creative with what you share! You don't need to adhere to this list.\n\n## Question 6\nCompletion of this question is only necessary if you have accommodations. If you have any learning accommodations, please email me about your needs. I should receive a direct email from the Office of Student Access, but it is important that we discuss how accommodations will translate to our class. \n",
