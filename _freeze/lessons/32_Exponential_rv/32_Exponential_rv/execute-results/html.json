Identify the variable and the parameters in a story, and state in English what the variable and its parameters mean.\n\n2.  Use the formulas for the density, CDF, expected value, and variance to answer questions and find probabilities.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.css .cell-code}\ncode.sourceCode {\n  font-size: 1.5em;\n  /* or try font-size: xx-large; */\n}\n```\n\n\n<style type=\"text/css\">\ncode.sourceCode {\n  font-size: 1.5em;\n  /* or try font-size: xx-large; */\n}\n</style>\n:::\n\n\n\n## Properties of exponential RVs\n\n-   **Scenario:** Modeling the time until the next (first) event\n\n-   Continuous analog to the geometric distribution!\n\n-   Shorthand: $X \\sim \\text{Exp}(\\lambda)$\n\n$$\nf_X(x) = \\lambda e^{-\\lambda x}\\text{ for } x>0, \\lambda>0\n$$\n\n$$\nF_X(x) = \\left\\{\n        \\begin{array}{ll}\n            0 & \\quad x<0 \\quad \\\\\n            1 - e^{-\\lambda x} & \\quad x\\geq0 \\\\\n        \\end{array}\n    \\right.\n$$\n\n$$\\text{E}(X) = \\dfrac{1}{\\lambda}$$ $$\\text{Var}(X) = \\dfrac{1}{\\lambda^2}$$\n\n## Memoryless Property\n\n   \n\nIf $b>0$,\n\n$$P(X > a +b | X> a) = P(X > b)$$\n\n     \n\n-   **This can be interpreted as:**\n\n    -   If you have waited $a$ seconds (or any other measure of time) without a success\n\n    -   Then the probability that you have to wait $b$ more seconds is the same as as the probability of waiting $b$ seconds initially.\n\n## Identifying exponential RV from word problems\n\n-   Look for time between events/successes\n\n-   Look for a rate of the events over time period\n\n-   How does it differ from the geometric distribution?\n\n    -   Geometric is *number of trials* until first success\n\n    -   Exponential is *time* until first success\n\n-   Relation to the Poisson distribution?\n\n    -   When the time between arrivals is exponential, the number of arrivals in a fixed time interval is Poisson with the mean $\\lambda$\n\n## Helpful R code\n\nLet's say we're sitting at the bus stop, measuring the time until our bus arrives. We know the bus comes every 10 minutes on average.\n\n-   If we want to know the probability that the bus arrives in the next 5 minutes:\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    pexp(q = 5, rate = 1/10)\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    ```\n    [1] 0.3934693\n    ```\n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n\n-   If we want to know the time, say $t$, where the probability of the bus arriving at $t$ or earlier is 0.35:\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    qexp(p = 0.35, rate = 1/10)\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    ```\n    [1] 4.307829\n    ```\n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n\n-   If we want to know the probability that the bus arrives between 3 and 5 minutes:\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    pexp(q = 5, rate = 1/10) - pexp(q = 3, rate = 1/10)\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    ```\n    [1] 0.1342876\n    ```\n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n\n-   If we want to sample 20 bus arrival times from the distribution:\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    rexp(n = 20, rate = 1/10)\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    ```\n     [1]  0.99673730 66.12062437 14.49579658  3.99838822 13.56471614  3.98639216\n     [7]  4.70838893  7.97777662 20.16520858  0.43174262  9.59612923 17.57753393\n    [13]  0.03792729 12.78806716  0.65926385  2.43805808 27.10900644 19.85506415\n    [19]  8.87837111 30.28163620\n    ```\n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n\n## Transformation of independent exponential RVs\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"30%\"}\n::: example\n::: ex-title\nExample 1\n:::\n\n::: ex-cont\nLet $X_i \\sim \\textrm{Exp}(\\lambda_i)$ be independent RVs, for $i=1 \\ldots n$.
