## Non-textbook problems (NTB)

1.  A new drug is packaged to contain 30 pills in a bottle. Suppose that 98% of all bottles contain no defective pills, 1.5% contain one defective pill, and 0.5% contain two defective pills. Two pills from a bottle are randomly selected and tested. What is the probability that there are 2 defective pills in the bottle given that one of the two tested pills is defective?
