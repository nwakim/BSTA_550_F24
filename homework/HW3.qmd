\* In addition to the graphs, include piecewise defined functions for the pmf and cdf.

\*\* Break up your solution to Chapter 9 #8 into the following 5 parts:

1.  Make a table of the joint probabilities for $X$ and $Y$.

2.  Using the table in the previous part, write down the piecewise-defined equation for $p_{X,Y}(x,y)$. There should be only 3 pieces (cases) for $p_{X,Y}(x,y)$.

3.  Express $p_Y(y)$ as a formula (i.e. a function in terms of $y$).

4.  Find the conditional pmf $p_{X|Y}(x|y)$ and express your answer as a piecewise-defined equation. There should be only 3 pieces (cases) for $p_{X|Y}(x|y)$.

5.  Make a table of the joint cdf $F_{X,Y}(x,y)$ values.

## Non-textbook problems (NTB)

1.  A new drug is packaged to contain 30 pills in a bottle. Suppose that 98% of all bottles contain no defective pills, 1.5% contain one defective pill, and 0.5% contain two defective pills. Two pills from a bottle are randomly selected and tested. What is the probability that there are 2 defective pills in the bottle given that one of the two tested pills is defective?

2.  The following table shows the results of a survey in which the subjects were a sample of 300 adults residing in a certain metropolitan area. Each subject was asked to indicate which of three policies they favored with respect to smoking in public places. (Table is from *Biostatistics: A Foundation for Analysis in the Health Sciences*, 10th Edition, Daniel, Wayne W.; Cross, Chad L., pg. 630)

    ![](Table_Smoking_vs_Education_Level.png){fig-align="center" width="6in"}

    Let $X=$ highest education level and $Y=$ policy favored. We can let $X=1$ for college graduate, $X=2$ for high-school graduate, etc., and similarly for $Y$, or just keep the category names for the different levels of $X$ and $Y$

    a.  Make a table for the joint pmf $p_{X,Y}(x,y)$ and briefly describe in words what the values are the probability of.

    b.  Find the marginal pmf $p_{X}(x)$ and briefly describe in words what the values are the probability of.

    c.  Find the marginal pmf $p_{Y}(y)$ and briefly describe in words what the values are the probability of.

    d.  Make a table for the joint cdf $F_{X,Y}(x,y)$ and briefly describe in words what the values are the probability of.

    e.  Find the marginal cdf $F_{X}(x)$ and briefly describe in words what the values are the probability of.

    f.  Find the marginal cdf $F_{Y}(y)$ and briefly describe in words what the values are the probability of.

    g.  Make a table for the conditional pmf $p_{X|Y}(x|y)$ and briefly describe in words what the values are the probability of.

    h.  Make a table for the conditional pmf $p_{Y|X}(y|x)$ and briefly describe in words what the values are the probability of.

3.  **Forgetful mornings revisited**. Using the joint pmf you found in Chapter 9 #2, complete the following questions:

    a.  Find the joint cdf of $X$ and $Y$ and briefly explain what $F_{X,Y}(x,y)$ represents in the context of the problem.

    b.  Find the conditional pmf $p_{Y|X}(y|x)$.
