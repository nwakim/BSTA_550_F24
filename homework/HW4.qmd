## Directions

[Please turn in this homework on Sakai.](https://sakai.ohsu.edu/portal/site/BSTA-550-1-12619-F23/tool/085b18e7-8118-4a51-ace5-0255aa46136e) Please submit your homework in pdf format. You can type your work on your computer or submit a photo of your written work or any other method that can be turned into a pdf. Please let me know if you greatly prefer to submit a physical copy. We can work out another way for you to turn in homework.

**Try to complete all of the problems listed below at some point this quarter! You may want to save some of them for studying later!** Only turn in the ones listed in the "Turn In" column. Please submit problems in the order they are listed.

The more work you include that shows your thought process, the more I can give you feedback.

\* Use Chapter 10 techniques when computing expected values for Chapter 10 problems, i.e. computing the expected value directly using the definition of $\mathbb{E}[X]$.

\*\* Use Chapter 11 techniques when computing expected values for Chapter 11 problems, i.e. expressing the r.v. as a sum of other r.v.'s and calculating the expected value of the sum of r.v.'s. Also, as I mentioned in class and posted on Sakai, we will be skipping the more complex examples of finding expected values using indicator r.v.'s. You can skip Examples 11.5, 11.10, and 11.11. We will not be covering these techniques.

\*\*\* Although Chapter 11 exercises, these are to be done using Chapter 10 techniques since we aren't covering the more complex examples of finding expected values using indicator r.v.'s.

## Non-textbook problems (NTB)

1.  The following table shows the results of a survey in which the subjects were a sample of 300 adults residing in a certain metropolitan area. Each subject was asked to indicate which of three policies they favored with respect to smoking in public places. (Table is from *Biostatistics: A Foundation for Analysis in the Health Sciences*, 10th Edition, Daniel, Wayne W.; Cross, Chad L., pg. 630)

    ![](Table_Smoking_vs_Education_Level.png){fig-align="center" width="6in"}

    Let $X=$ highest education level and $Y=$ policy favored. We can let $X=1$ for college graduate, $X=2$ for high-school graduate, etc., and similarly for $Y$, or just keep the category names for the different levels of $X$ and $Y$

    a.  Make a table for the joint pmf $p_{X,Y}(x,y)$ and briefly describe in words what the values are the probability of.

    b.  Find the marginal pmf $p_{X}(x)$ and briefly describe in words what the values are the probability of.

    c.  Find the marginal pmf $p_{Y}(y)$ and briefly describe in words what the values are the probability of.

    d.  Make a table for the joint cdf $F_{X,Y}(x,y)$ and briefly describe in words what the values are the probability of.

    e.  Find the marginal cdf $F_{X}(x)$ and briefly describe in words what the values are the probability of.

    f.  Find the marginal cdf $F_{Y}(y)$ and briefly describe in words what the values are the probability of.

    g.  Make a table for the conditional pmf $p_{X|Y}(x|y)$ and briefly describe in words what the values are the probability of.

    h.  Make a table for the conditional pmf $p_{Y|X}(y|x)$ and briefly describe in words what the values are the probability of.

2.  **Forgetful mornings revisited**. Using the joint pmf you found in Chapter 9 #2, complete the following questions:

    a.  Find the joint cdf of $X$ and $Y$ and briefly explain what $F_{X,Y}(x,y)$ represents in the context of the problem.

    b.  Find the conditional pmf $p_{Y|X}(y|x)$.

3.  **Forgetful mornings revisited again**. Recall from Chapter 9 #2, that $X$ is the number of days until Maude loses her cell phone and each day she has a 1% chance of losing her phone (her behavior on different days being independent). For this problem, ignore the r.v. $Y$, and consider the r.v. $X$ on its own.

    a.  What is the pmf of $X$?

    b.  Use the pmf of $X$ to find $\mathbb{E}[X]$.

4.  Approximately 10% of U.S. Veterans are women. Suppose an investigator plans a study with 4500 participants that are Veterans. How many women can they expect to be included? *Your answer must be calculated by defining a random variable and showing how to calculate the expected value.*

5.  **Cashews revisited**. Recall from Chapter 10 #8, that a bowl contains 30 cashews, 20 pecans, 25 almonds, and 25 walnuts, and 3 nuts are randomly selected to eat (without replacement). Again, find the expected value of the number of cashews, but this time by defining the number of cashews as a sum of random variables.
