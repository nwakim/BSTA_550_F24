## Non-textbook problems (NTB)

1.  Suppose the following are the percentage of US adults with the following conditions:

    -   $A$: Hypertension 33%

    -   $B$: Diabetes 9%

    -   $C$: Metabolic syndrome 24%

    -   $A$ or $B$: 39%

    -   $A$ or $C$: 45%

    -   $B$ or $C$: 28%

    -   $A$ or $B$ or $C$: 48%

    a.  Make a Venn diagram of the 3 conditions labeling the percentage (or probability) for *ALL* of the 8 "sections". *Hint: Start from the last condition and work your way up!*
    b.  For each of the following (1. - 7. below), ($i$) write out the event using unions, intersections, and/or complements of the events $A$, $B$, and $C$ (this is NOT finding the probability, that's in $ii$); ($ii$) find the probability of the event; and ($iii$) write a sentence explaining what the probability is of in terms of the context of the problem.
        1.  $\mathbb{P}$(event at least one of the 3)

        2.  $\mathbb{P}$(event none)

        3.  $\mathbb{P}$(event $A$ only)

        4.  $\mathbb{P}$(event exactly one)

        5.  $\mathbb{P}$(event $A$ and $B$)

        6.  $\mathbb{P}$(event $A$ and $B$ but not $C$)

        7.  $\mathbb{P}$(event all 3)
