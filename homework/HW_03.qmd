## Directions

[Please turn in this homework on Sakai.](https://sakai.ohsu.edu/portal/site/BSTA-550-1-14926-F24/tool/c8320b13-1b6d-42ed-9c19-134634cf25af) Please submit your homework in pdf format. You can type your work on your computer or submit a photo of your written work or any other method that can be turned into a pdf. The Adobe Scan phone app is an easy way to scan photos and compile into a PDF. Please let me know if you greatly prefer to submit a physical copy. We can work out another way for you to turn in homework.

**Try to complete all of the problems listed below at some point this quarter! You may want to save some of them for studying later!** Only turn in the ones listed in the "Turn In" column. Please submit problems in the order they are listed.

*You must show all of your work to receive credit.*

$^\#$ Break up your solution to Chapter 9 #8 into the following 5 parts:

1.  Make a table of the joint probabilities for $X$ and $Y$.

2.  Using the table in the previous part, write down the piecewise-defined equation for $p_{X,Y}(x,y)$. There should be only 3 pieces (cases) for $p_{X,Y}(x,y)$.

3.  Express $p_Y(y)$ as a formula (i.e. a function in terms of $y$).

4.  Find the conditional pmf $p_{X|Y}(x|y)$ and express your answer as a piecewise-defined equation. There should be only 3 pieces (cases) for $p_{X|Y}(x|y)$.

5.  Make a table of the joint cdf $F_{X,Y}(x,y)$ values.

\* In addition to the graphs, include piecewise defined functions for the pmf and cdf.

\*\* Use Chapter 10 techniques when computing expected values for Chapter 10 problems, i.e. computing the expected value directly using the definition of $\mathbb{E}[X]$.

## Non-textbook problems (NTB)

1.  The following table shows the results of a survey in which the subjects were a sample of 300 adults residing in a certain metropolitan area. Each subject was asked to indicate which of three policies they favored with respect to smoking in public places. (Table is from *Biostatistics: A Foundation for Analysis in the Health Sciences*, 10th Edition, Daniel, Wayne W.; Cross, Chad L., pg. 630)

    ![](Table_Smoking_vs_Education_Level.png){fig-align="center" width="6in"}

    Let $X=$ highest education level and $Y=$ policy favored. We can let $X=1$ for college graduate, $X=2$ for high-school graduate, etc., and similarly for $Y$, or just keep the category names for the different levels of $X$ and $Y$

    a.  Make a table for the joint pmf $p_{X,Y}(x,y)$ and briefly describe in words what the values are the probability of.

    b.  Find the marginal pmf $p_{X}(x)$ and briefly describe in words what the values are the probability of.

    c.  Find the marginal pmf $p_{Y}(y)$ and briefly describe in words what the values are the probability of.

    d.  Make a table for the joint cdf $F_{X,Y}(x,y)$ and briefly describe in words what the values are the probability of.

    e.  Find the marginal cdf $F_{X}(x)$ and briefly describe in words what the values are the probability of.

    f.  Find the marginal cdf $F_{Y}(y)$ and briefly describe in words what the values are the probability of.

    g.  Make a table for the conditional pmf $p_{X|Y}(x|y)$ and briefly describe in words what the values are the probability of.

    h.  Make a table for the conditional pmf $p_{Y|X}(y|x)$ and briefly describe in words what the values are the probability of.

2.  Each day, Maude has a 1% chance of losing her cell phone (her behavior on different days is independent). Each day, Maude has a 3% chance of forgetting to eat breakfast (again, her behavior on different days is independent). Her breakfast and cell phone habits are independent. Let X be the number of days until she first loses her cell phone. Let Y be the number of days until she first forgets to eat breakfast. (Here, X and Y are independent.)

    a.  Find the joint probability mass function of X and Y.

    b.  Find the joint cdf of $X$ and $Y$ and briefly explain what $F_{X,Y}(x,y)$ represents in the context of the problem.

    c.  Find the conditional pmf $p_{Y|X}(y|x)$.
