## Directions

[Please turn in this homework on Sakai.](https://sakai.ohsu.edu/portal/site/BSTA-550-1-14926-F24/tool/c8320b13-1b6d-42ed-9c19-134634cf25af) Please submit your homework in pdf format. You can type your work on your computer or submit a photo of your written work or any other method that can be turned into a pdf. The Adobe Scan phone app is an easy way to scan photos and compile into a PDF. Please let me know if you greatly prefer to submit a physical copy. We can work out another way for you to turn in homework.

**Try to complete all of the problems listed below at some point this quarter! You may want to save some of them for studying later!** Only turn in the ones listed in the "Turn In" column. Please submit problems in the order they are listed.

*You must show all of your work to receive credit.*

## Non-textbook problems (NTB)

1.  Let $X_i\sim$ Binomial($n_i,p$) be independent r.v.'s for $i=1,\ldots,m$.

    a.  What does the r.v. $X=\sum_{i=1}^mX_i$ count, and what is the distribution of $X$? Make sure to specify the parameters of $X$'s distribution.

    b.  Find $\mathbb{E}[X]$. *Make sure to show your work for (b) and (c). However, you may use without proof what you know about the mean and variance of each* $X_i$.

    c.  Find $Var[X]$.


### Extra Problems

2.  Read the Washington Post article *The amazing woman who can smell Parkinson's disease - before symptoms appear* (<http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/10/23/scottish-woman-detects-a-musky-smell-that-could-radically-improve-how-parkinsons-disease-is-diagnosed/>)

    Assuming Joy Milne does not have the ability to detect Parkinson's disease via smell, answer the following questions:

    a.  What is the probability of her correctly detecting Parkinson's by smelling one t-shirt?

    b.  What is the probability of her correctly detecting Parkinson's in 12 out of 12 t-shirts?

3.  Let $X_i\sim$ Negative Binomial($r_i,p$) be independent r.v.'s for $i=1,\ldots,m$.

    a.  What does the r.v. $X=\sum_{i=1}^mX_i$ count, and what is the distribution of $X$? Make sure to specify the parameters of $X$'s distribution.

    b.  Find $\mathbb{E}[X]$. *Make sure to show your work for (b) and (c). However, you may use without proof what you know about the mean and variance of each* $X_i$.

    c.  Find $Var[X]$.
