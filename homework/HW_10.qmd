## Directions

[Please turn in this homework on Sakai.](https://sakai.ohsu.edu/portal/site/BSTA-550-1-14926-F24/tool/c8320b13-1b6d-42ed-9c19-134634cf25af) Please submit your homework in pdf format. You can type your work on your computer or submit a photo of your written work or any other method that can be turned into a pdf. The Adobe Scan phone app is an easy way to scan photos and compile into a PDF. Please let me know if you greatly prefer to submit a physical copy. We can work out another way for you to turn in homework.

**Try to complete all of the problems listed below at some point this quarter! You may want to save some of them for studying later!** Only turn in the ones listed in the "Turn In" column. Please submit problems in the order they are listed.

*You must show all of your work to receive credit.*

\* Include in your answer an explanation as to why we need the condition that $t<\lambda$.

\*\* Do parts (a)-(c) below for #10 and #12:

-   Answer the question using the mgf $M_X(t)$ as instructed in the book.

-   Answer the question using $R_X(t)$ (as defined in class, and NTB [\[Ch43_R_Var\]](#Ch43_R_Var){reference-type="ref" reference="Ch43_R_Var"} below).

-   Which method did you prefer? Why?


## Non-textbook problems (NTB)

1.  Let $R_X(t)=\ln(M_X(t))$. Show
    that Var$(X)=R''_X(0)$.

2.  The mgf for a Gamma
    distribution is $M_X(t)=\frac{1}{(1-t/\lambda)^r}$. Use the mgf of
    an Exponential distribution (from #43.9), to show that the sum of
    $n$ i.i.d. Exponential($\lambda)$ random variables has a
    Gamma($r,\lambda$) distribution.

3.  Use the mgf of a
    Poisson distribution to find the mgf of the following distributions.
    If the mgf is that of a common named distribution, then name the
    distribution and state its parameter(s).

    1.  The distribution of $\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$, if
        $X_i\sim$Poisson$(\lambda_i)$ and are independent.

    2.  The distribution of $\sum_{i=1}^3X_i$, if
        $X_i\sim$Poisson$(\lambda)$ and are independent (i.i.d. in this
        case).

    3.  The distribution of $3X$, if $X\sim$Poisson$(\lambda)$.

    4.  Why are the answers to (b) and (c) different?

4.  Using
    mgf's, show that the sum of $n$ i.i.d. Chi Square random variables
    with one degree of freedom ($\chi^2_{(1)}$) r.v.'s has a Chi Square
    with $n$ degrees of freedom ($\chi^2_{(n)}$) distribution.

    *Hint:* First, look up the pdf of a $\chi^2_{(n)}$. This is a
    special case of the Gamma distribution with what parameters? Based
    on that and the information from \#
    [\[Ch43_SumExpGamma\]](#Ch43_SumExpGamma){reference-type="ref"
    reference="Ch43_SumExpGamma"} above, you can determine what the mgf
    of a $\chi^2_{(n)}$ is, which will help you determine whether the
    mgf of the sum of $n$ i.i.d. $\chi^2_{(1)}$ r.v.'s has a
    $\chi^2_{(n)}$ distribution.
