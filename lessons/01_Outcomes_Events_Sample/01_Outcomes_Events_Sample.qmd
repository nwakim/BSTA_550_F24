## Learning Objectives

1.  Define basic terms related to events such as events, outcomes, and sample space.

2.  Use proper set notation for events

3.  Characterize possible outcomes, when something random occurs

4.  Describe events into which outcomes can be grouped

5.  Define important terms and rules within set theory such as unions, intersections, complements, mutually exclusive, and De Morgan's Laws

# Tossing One Coin (Outcomes, Events, and Sample Space)

## Coin Toss Example: 1 coin (1/3)

**Suppose you toss one coin.**

-   What are the possible outcomes?

     

-   What is the sample space?

     

-   What are the possible events?

## Coin Toss Example: 1 coin (2/3)

**Suppose you toss one coin.**

-   What are the possible outcomes?

    -   Heads ($H$)

    -   Tails ($T$)

 

::: fact
::: fact-title
Note
:::

::: fact-cont
When something happens at random, such as a coin toss, there are several possible outcomes, and *exactly one* of the outcomes will occur.

## Definitions: Sample Space and Events

::: definition
::: def-title
Definition: Sample Space
:::

::: def-cont
The **sample space** $S$ is the set of *all* outcomes
:::
:::

::: definition
::: def-title
Definition: Event
:::

::: def-cont
An **event** is a *collection of some* outcomes. An event can include multiple outcomes or no outcomes (a subset of the sample space).
:::
:::

When thinking about events, think about outcomes that you might be asking the probability of. For example, what is the probability that you get a heads and a tails in one flip? (Answer: 0)

::: fact
::: fact-title
Note #1
:::

::: fact-cont
We use curly brackets ($\{\}$) to denote a set (collecting a list of outcomes or values)
:::
:::

::: fact
::: fact-title
Note #2
:::

::: fact-cont
The total number of possible events is $$2^{|S|}$$ where $|S|$ is the total number of outcomes in the sample space. Also, possible events are not necessarily something that can actually occur (i.e. getting a heads and a tails on a single coin flip)

# Tossing Two Coins (Outcomes, Events, and Sample Space)

## Coin Toss Example: 2 coins

**Suppose you toss two coins.**

-   What is the sample space? *Assume the coins are distinguishable*

    -   $S =$

 

-   What are some possible events?

    -   $A =$ exactly one $H =$

    -   $B =$ at least one $H =$

    -   

    -   

## More info on events and sample spaces

-   We usually use capital letters from the beginning of the alphabet to denote events. However, other letters might be chosen to be more descriptive.

 

-   We use the notation $|S|$ to denote the **size** of the sample space.

 

-   The total number of possible events is $2^{|S|}$, which is the total number of possible subsets of $S$. 

 

-   The **empty set**, denoted by $\emptyset$, is the set containing no outcomes.

## Example: Keep sampling until...

**Suppose you keep sampling people until you have someone with high blood pressure (BP)**

 

**What is the sample space?**

-   Let $H =$ denote someone with high BP.

-   Let $H^C =$ denote someone with not high blood pressure, such as low or regular BP.

 

-   Then, $S =$

# Set Theory

## Set Theory (1/2)

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
 

::: definition
::: def-title
Definition: Union
:::

::: def-cont
The **union** of events $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A \cup B$, contains all outcomes that are in $A$ *or* $B$ or both
:::
:::

::: definition
::: def-title
Definition: Intersection
:::

::: def-cont
The **intersection** of events $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A \cap B$, contains all outcomes that are both in $A$ *and* $B$.
:::

## Set Theory (2/2)

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
 

::: definition
::: def-title
Definition: Complement
:::

::: def-cont
The **complement** of event $A$, denoted by $A^C$ or $A'$, contains all outcomes in the sample space $S$ that are *not* in $A$ .
:::
:::

::: definition
::: def-title
Definition: Mutually Exclusive
:::

::: def-cont
Events $A$ and $B$ are **mutually exclusive**, or disjoint, if they have no outcomes in common. In this case $A \cap B = \emptyset$, where $\emptyset$ is the empty set.

## BP example variation (1/3)

-   Suppose you have $n$ subjects in a study.

-   Let $H_i$ be the event that person $i$ has high BP, for $i=1\ldots n$.

 

*Use set theory notation to denote the following events:*

1.  Event subject $i$ does not have high BP

2.  Event all $n$ subjects have high BP

3.  Event at least one subject has high BP

4.  Event all of them do not have high BP

5.  Event at least one subject does not have high BP

## BP example variation (2/3)

-   Let $H_i$ be the event that person $i$ has high BP, for $i=1\ldots n$.

*Use set theory notation to denote the following events:*

1.  Event subject $i$ does not have high BP

     

2.  Event all $n$ subjects have high BP

## De Morgan's Laws

::: theorem
::: thm-title
Theorem: De Morgan's 1st Law
:::

::: thm-cont
For a collection of events (sets) $A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots$

$$\bigcap\limits_{i=1}^{n}A_i^C = \Big(\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{n}A_i\Big)^C$$
:::
:::

"all not A = $($at least one event A$)^C$" or "intersection of the complements is the complement of the union"

::: theorem
::: thm-title
Theorem: De Morgan's 2nd Law
:::

::: thm-cont
For a collection of events (sets) $A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots$

$$\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{n}A_i^C = \Big(\bigcap\limits_{i=1}^{n}A_i\Big)^C$$
:::
:::

"at least one event not A = $($all A$)^C$" or "union of complements is complement of the intersection"

## Remarks on De Morgan's Laws

-   These laws also hold for infinite collections of events.

     

-   Draw Venn diagrams to convince yourself that these are true!

     

-   These laws are *very* useful when calculating probabilities.

    -   This is because calculating the probability of the **intersection of events is often much easier than the union of events**.

    -   This is not obvious right now, but we will see in the coming chapters why.
