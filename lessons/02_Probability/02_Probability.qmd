# Learning Objectives

1.  Define basic axioms and propositions in probability

2.  Assign probabilities to events, and perform manipulations on probabilities to make calculations easier

## Where are we?

# Probabilities of equally likely events

## Probabilities of equally likely events

- "Equally likely" means the probability of any possible outcome is the same
  - Think: each side of die is equally likely or picking a card in a deck is equally likely

## Pick an *equally likely* card, any *equally likely* card

::: example
::: ex-title
Example 1
:::

::: ex-cont
Suppose you have a regular well-shuffled deck of cards. What's the probability of drawing:

1.  any heart

2.  the queen of hearts

3.  any queen
:::

## Let's break down this probability

If $S$ is a finite sample space, with **equally likely outcomes**, then

$$\mathbb{P}(A) = \frac{|A|}{|S|}$$

In human speak: 

- For equally likely outcomes, the probability that a certain event occurs is: the number of outcomes within the event of interest ($|A|$) **divided by** the total number of possible outcomes ($|S|$)

- Thus, it is important to be able to count the outcomes within an event

## A probability is a function...

- $\mathbb{P}(A)$ is a function with

    -   **Input:** event $A$ from the sample space $S$, ($A \subseteq S$)

        - $A \subseteq S$ means "A contained within S" or "A is a subset of S"

    -   **Output:** a number between 0 and 1 (inclusive)
    
 

- The probability function maps an event (or something within our sample space) to value between 0 and 1 

  - When we speak of the probability function, we often call the values between 0 and 1 "probabilities"
  
    - Example: "The probability of drawing a heart is 0.25" for $P(\text{heart}) = 0.25$ 

 

- The probability function needs to follow some specific rules!

# Probability Axioms

## Probability Axioms

::: axiom
::: axiom-title
Axiom 1
:::

::: axiom-cont
For every event $A$, $0\leq\mathbb{P}(A)\leq 1$. Probability is between 0 and 1.
:::
:::

::: axiom
::: axiom-title
Axiom 2
:::

::: axiom-cont
For the sample space $S$, $\mathbb{P}(S)=1$.
:::
:::

::: axiom
::: axiom-title
Axiom 3
:::

::: axiom-cont
If $A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots$, is a collection of **disjoint** events, then $$\mathbb{P}\Big( \bigcup \limits_{i=1}^{\infty}A_i\Big) =  \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\mathbb{P}(A_i).$$

# Partitions

## Partitions

::: columns

::: definition
::: def-title
Definition: Partition
:::

::: def-cont
A set of events $\{A_i\}_{i=1}^{n}$ create a **partition** of $A$, if

-   the $A_i$'s are disjoint (mutually exclusive) and

-   $\bigcup \limits_{i=1}^n A_i = A$
:::
:::

::: example
::: ex-title
Example 2
:::

::: ex-cont
-   If $A \subset B$, then $\{A, B \cap A^C\}$ is a partition of $B$.

-   If $S = \bigcup \limits_{i=1}^n A_i$, and the $A_i$'s are disjoint, then the $A_i$'s are a partition of the sample space.

Creating partitions is sometimes used to help calculate probabilities, since by Axiom 3 we can add the probabilities of disjoint events.

Example 3
:::

::: ex-cont
If a subject has an

-   80% chance of taking their medication *this* week,

-   70% chance of taking their medication *next* week, and

-   10% chance of *not* taking their medication *either* week,

then find the probability of them taking their medication exactly one of the two weeks.
