## 1. Proofs of propositions

Further explanations of the propositions can be found in the textbook from pages 24-27. For many of the explanations in class, I was working to produce a union of disjoint events, so that the probability could easily be calculated. Proposition 3 and 4 were specifically mentioned, so I will include some writing notes on them here:

### Proposition 3

If $A \subseteq B$, then $\mathbb{P}(A) \leq \mathbb{P}(B)$

In this proposition, I want to define event $B$ as a union of disjoint events so that I can show $P(B)$ is the sum of $P(A)$ and some greater-than-or-equal-to 0 probability event. If the following is my venn diagram of A and B:

Then I can define B as the union of disjoint events: ![](images/Muddy_point_4_1_2.png)

If we then take the probability of each side of the equation $B = A \cup (A^c \cap B)$, we get $$P(B) = P\big(A \cup (A^c \cap B)\big)$$

Since events $A$ and $A^c \cap B$ are disjoint, the probability of their union is just: $$P(A) + P(A^c \cap B)$$

Thus, our equation is now $$P(B) = P(A) + P(A^c \cap B)$$

From Axiom 1, we know for event $A^c \cap B$, $P(A^c \cap B) \geq 0$.

So the probability of event B is the sum of the probability of event A and an event that is $\geq$ 0. This means $P(B) \geq P(A)$.

### Proposition 4

$\mathbb{P}(A \cup B) = \mathbb{P}(A) + \mathbb{P}(B) - \mathbb{P}(A \cap B)$

From the pictures above, we can see some similar disjoint events.

If we look back at $A \cup B$, we can start manipulating the right side of the equation:

## 3. Example at end of Chapter 2 slides (Venn Diagram)

I will post this in the previous week's Muddy Points as well. [Please follow this link for my work through of the example.](https://ohsuitg-my.sharepoint.com/personal/wakim_ohsu_edu/_layouts/15/stream.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fwakim%5Fohsu%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2FTeaching%2FClasses%2FF2023%5FBSTA%5F550%2FRecordings%2F02%5FProbability%5Fexample%2Emp4&referrer=OneDriveForBusiness&referrerScenario=OpenFile) And [here is the PDF with my work](/slides_annotated/02_Probability_example.pdf).

**Sub-question:** why don't we just multiply the probability of A and B to get the intersection? This is a specific property of probability when A and B are independent. Only when A and B are independent can we conclude that $P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$.

## 6. Partition of events

We've been working with event partitions throughout Chapter 2, but we have not formally identified them. Partitions are advantageous to define for two reasons:

1.  The partitions may be easier to calculate. We can then use the partitions to reconstruct other probabilities that may be more difficult to calculate

2.  Partitions have nice properties as a consequence of being disjoint. For example, the probability of the union of partitions is the sum of the probabilities across each partition: $$P\bigg(\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\bigg) = P(A_1)P(A_2)P(A_3) \cdot \cdot \cdot P(A_n)$$
