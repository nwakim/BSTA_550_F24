## Learning Objectives

1.  Use set process to calculate probability of event of interest

2.  Calculate the probability of an event occurring, given that another event occurred.

3.  Define keys facts for conditional probabilities using notation.

## Where are we?

## General Process for Probability Word Problems

1.  Clearly define your events of interest

2.  Translate question to probability using defined events OR Venn Diagram

3.  Ask yourself:

    -   Are we sampling with or without replacement?

    -   Does order matter?

4.  Use axioms, properties, partitions, facts, etc. to define the end probability calculation into smaller parts

    -   If probabilities are given to you, Venn Diagrams may help you parse out the events and probability calculations

    -   If you need to find probabilities with counting, pictures or diagrams might help here

5.  Write out a concluding statement that gives the probability context

6.  (For own check) Make sure the calculated probability follows the axioms. Is is between 0 and 1?

## Let's revisit our deck of cards

Example 1
:::

::: ex-cont
Suppose we randomly draw 2 cards from a standard deck of cards. What is the probability that we draw a spade then a heart?
:::
:::

Let

-   Let $A =$ event $1^{st}$ card is spades

-   Let $B =$ event $2^{nd}$ card is heart

## Conditional Probability facts (1/2)

::: columns
::: column
::: fact
::: fact-title
Fact 1: General Multiplication Rule
:::

::: fact-cont
$$\mathbb{P}(A\cap B)=\mathbb{P}(A)\cdot\mathbb{P}(B|A)$$
:::
:::
:::

::: column
::: fact
::: fact-title
Fact 2: Conditional Probability Definition
:::

::: fact-cont
$$\mathbb{P}(A|B)=\frac{\mathbb{P}(A\cap B)}{\mathbb{P}(B)}$$
:::
:::
:::

## Conditional Probability facts (2/2)

::: columns
::: column
::: fact
::: fact-title
Fact 3
:::

::: fact-cont
If $A$ and $B$ are independent events ($A \unicode{x2AEB}B$), then $$\mathbb{P}(A|B) = \mathbb{P}(A)$$
:::
:::
:::

::: column
::: fact
::: fact-title
Fact 4
:::

::: fact-cont
$\mathbb{P}(A|B)$ is a probability, meaning that it satisfies the probability axioms. In particular, $$\mathbb{P}(A|B) + \mathbb{P}(A^C|B) = 1$$

## Conditional probability with two dice

::: columns
::: column
::: example
::: ex-title
Example 2
:::

::: ex-cont
Two dice (red and blue) are rolled. If the dice do not show the same face, what is the probability that one of the dice is a 1?
