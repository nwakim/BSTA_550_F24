## Announcements

- For office hours, we decided to do appointments!
  - Here's my Calendly: <https://calendly.com/nickywakim/15min>
  - I teach on Mondays and Wednesdays so I am keeping most of my meetings to Tuesdays and Thursdays
  - For my EPI class, I have scheduled office hours on Mondays 4-5pm in VPT 627
    - I will give priority to EPI students, but you can drop by for those as well
    
- I think all the dates in the schedule were correct except for next week

## Key Dates

- HW 1 Assignment due this Thursday at 11pm
