## Revisiting our two card draw

::: columns

::: example
::: ex-title
Example 1
:::

::: ex-cont
Suppose you draw 2 cards from a standard deck of cards *with* replacement. Let $X$ be the number of hearts you draw. Find $\mathbb{E}[X]$.
:::
:::

::: example
::: ex-cont
<font size=6ex>Recall Binomial RV with $n=2$:

$$p_X(x) = {2 \choose x}p^x(1-p)^{2-x} \text{Â  for } x = 0, 1, 2$$

## What if we draw A LOT of cards?

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
::: example
::: ex-title
Example 2
:::

::: ex-cont
What is the expected number of hearts in Example 1 if you draw 200 cards?
:::
:::

::: example
::: ex-cont
<font size=6ex>Recall Binomial RV with $n=200$:

$$p_X(x) = {200 \choose x}p^x(1-p)^{200-x}$$
$$\text{Â  for } x = 0, 1, 2, ..., 200$$

## Sum of discrete RVs

::: theorem
::: thm-title
Theorem 11.1: Sum of discrete RVs
:::

::: thm-cont
For discrete r.v.'s $X_i$ and constants $a_i$, $i=1,2,\dots, n$, $$\mathbb{E}\Bigg[\sum_{i=1}^n a_iX_i\Bigg] = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i\mathbb{E}[X_i] .$$ **Remark:** The theorem holds for infinitely r.v.'s $X_i$ as well.
:::
:::

-   For two RVs, $X$ and $Y$:
    -   We can say $E[X+Y] = E[X] + E[Y]$
    -   ... and constant numbers $a$ and $b$, we can also say $E[aX+bY] = aE[X] + bE[Y]$
    -   We can also also say $E[X-Y] = E[X] - E[Y]$, since $b=-1$

## Corollaries from Thm 11.1

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: proposition
::: prop-title
Corollary 11.1.1
:::

::: prop-cont
For a discrete r.v. $X$, and constants $a$ and $b$, $$\mathbb{E}[aX+b] = a\mathbb{E}[X] + b.$$
:::
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: proposition
::: prop-title
Corollary 11.1.2
:::

::: prop-cont
If $X_i$, $i=1,2,\dots, n$, are identically distributed r.v.'s, then $$\mathbb{E}\bigg[\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\bigg] = n\mathbb{E}[X_1] .$$

## Revisiting our ghost! ðŸ‘»

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
::: example
::: ex-title
Example 3
:::

::: ex-cont
The ghost is trick-or-treating at a different house now. In this case it is known that the bag of candy has 10 chocolates, 20 lollipops, and 30 laffy taffies. The ghost grabs a handful of five pieces of candy. How many pieces of chocolate do we expect the ghost to take?

## Cost of hotel rooms

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
::: example
::: ex-title
Example 4
:::

::: ex-cont
A tour group is planning a visit to the city of Minneapolis and needs to book 30 hotel rooms. The average price of a room is \$200. In addition, there is a 10% tourism tax for each room. What is the expected cost for the 30 hotel rooms?
