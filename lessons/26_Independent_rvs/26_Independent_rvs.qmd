## Learning Objectives

1. Show that a joint pdf consists of two independent, continuous RVs.

2. Combine two independent RVs into one joint pdf or CDF.

## How do we represent independent continuous RVs in a joint pdf?

**What do we know about independence for events and discrete RVs?**

For events: If $A \perp B$

$$P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$$ $$P(A|B) = P(A)$$

For discrete RVs: If $X \perp Y$ $$p_{X,Y}(x,y) = p_{X}(x)p_{Y}(y)$$
$$F_{X,Y}(x,y) = F_{X}(x)F_{Y}(y)$$ $$p_{X|Y}(x|y) = p_{X}(x)$$
$$p_{Y|X}(y|x) = p_{Y}(y)$$

**What does it mean for continuous r.v.'s to be independent?**

For continuous RVs: If $X \perp Y$

Example 1.1
:::
::: ex-cont
Let $X$ and $Y$ be independent r.v.'s with
$f_X(x)= \frac12$, for $0 \leq x \leq 2$ and $f_Y(y)= 3y^2$, for
$0 \leq y \leq 1$.

1.  Find $f_{X,Y}(x,y)$.

Do this problem at home for extra practice. The solution is available in
Meike's video!

Example 3
:::
::: ex-cont
Let $f_{X,Y}(x,y)= 2 e^{-(x+y)}$, for
$0 \leq x \leq y$. Are $X$ and $Y$ independent?

## Final statement on independence

1.  If $f_{X,Y}(x,y)= g(x)h(y)$, where $g(x)$ and $h(y)$ are pdf's, then
    $X$ and $Y$ are independent.

    -   The domain of the joint pdf needs to be independent as well!!
    
 
 
 
 

2.  If $F_{X,Y}(x,y)= G(x)H(y)$, where $G(x)$ and $H(y)$ are cdf's, then
    $X$ and $Y$ are independent.

    -   The domain of the joint CDF needs to be independent as well!!
