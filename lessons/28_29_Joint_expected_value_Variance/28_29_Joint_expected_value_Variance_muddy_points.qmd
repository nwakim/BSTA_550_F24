Muddy points from Fall 2023:

### 2. How do we set the bounds on a double integral?

When the domain of the RVs are not dependent on each other, then we use the bounds as is. In example 2 of Chapter 26 notes, we have the joint pdf $f_{X,Y}(x,y)= 18 x^2 y^5$, for$0 \leq x \leq 1, \ 0 \leq y \leq 1$. If we wanted to calculate something like $E(X)$, then we could use the bounds as they are. Below is the domain for $x$ and $y$:

Here is the integral for the expected value where we integrate over the whole domain of $x$ and $y$:

$$ E(X) = \displaystyle\int_0^1 \displaystyle\int_0^1 x (18 x^2 y^5 )dy dx $$If we want to find the probability $P(0.25 \leq X \leq 0.5, 0.5 \leq Y \leq 0.75)$, then we can look at the specific values of the probability:

![](images/Muddy_point_w5_02_02.png){fig-align="center" width="400"}

Note the blue lines above indicate how we integrate over $y$ first from 0.5 to 0.75 and the green lines indicate how integrate over $x$ first from 0.25 to 0.5. It seems like we've integrated over an area that isn't within our specified probability. However, the integrated area is ONLY the overlap of the $x$ and $y$ bounds for the probability.

$$P(0.25 \leq X \leq 0.5, 0.5 \leq Y \leq 0.75) = \displaystyle\int_{0.25}^{0.5} \displaystyle\int_{0.5}^{0.75} 18 x^2 y^5 dy dx$$

Let's use the same pdf, but now the domain of the two RVs is dependent on one another. We have the joint pdf $f_{X,Y}(x,y)= 18 x^2 y^5$, for$0 \leq x \leq y\leq1$

If we wanted to calculate something like $E(X)$, then we need to account for fact that $x$ must be less than of equal to $y$. We can look back at the domain for this:

![](images/Muddy_point_w5_02_03.png){fig-align="center" width="400"}

Note the blue lines above still indicate how we integrate over $y$ first from $x$ to 1, and the green lines indicate how integrate over $x$ first from 0 to 1. Once again, it seems like we've integrated over an area that isn't within the domain. However, the integrated area is ONLY the overlap of the $x$ and $y$ bounds. Thus, once we've restricted $y$ to the area between $x$ and 1, we no longer need to restrict $x$ to the are of 0 to $y$.

$$ E(X) = \displaystyle\int_0^1 \displaystyle\int_x^1 x (18 x^2 y^5 )dy dx $$ If we want to find the probability $P(0.25 \leq X \leq 0.5, 0.5 \leq Y \leq 0.75)$, then we should look back at our domain. For now, we are focusing on the orange area:

![](images/Muddy_point_w5_02_04.png){fig-align="center" width="400"}

Because the orange area is totally within our domain, we can leave our integral our bounds as the exact values we specified:

$$P(0.25 \leq X \leq 0.5, 0.5 \leq Y \leq 0.75) = \displaystyle\int_{0.25}^{0.5} \displaystyle\int_{0.5}^{0.75} 18 x^2 y^5 dy dx$$

However, if we want the probability $P(0.5 \leq X \leq 0.75, 0.5 \leq Y \leq 0.75)$, we would focus on the pink area above. We would limit one of our integrals to the $y=x$ equation:

$$P(0.5 \leq X \leq 0.75, 0.5 \leq Y \leq 0.75) = \displaystyle\int_{0.5}^{0.75} \displaystyle\int_{x}^{0.75} 18 x^2 y^5 dy dx$$

OR

$$P(0.5 \leq X \leq 0.75, 0.5 \leq Y \leq 0.75) = \displaystyle\int_{0.5}^{0.75} \displaystyle\int_{0.5}^{y} 18 x^2 y^5 dx dy$$

The key to these probabilities is that the bounds with the other variable is on the inside integral! Otherwise we end up with a answer that includes a RV.
