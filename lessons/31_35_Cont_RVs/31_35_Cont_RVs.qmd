# Learning Objectives

1.  Distinguish between Uniform, Exponential, Gamma, and Normal distributions when
    reading a story.
2.  Identify the variable and the parameters in a story, and state what
    the variable and parameters mean.
3.  Use the formulas for the pdf/CDF, expected value, and variance to
    answer questions and find probabilities.

# Chapter 31: Uniform RVs

## Properties of continuous uniform RVs

-   **Scenario:** Events are equally likely to happen anywhere or anytime in an interval of values

-   Shorthand: $X \sim \text{U}[a,b]$

$$
f_X(x) = \dfrac{1}{b-a}, \text{ for }a \leq x \leq b
$$

$$
F_X(x) = \left\{
        \begin{array}{ll}
            0 & \quad x<a \quad \\
            \dfrac{x-a}{b-a} & \quad a \leq x \leq b\quad \\
            1 & \quad x>b \quad
        \end{array}
    \right.
$$

$$\text{E}(X) = \dfrac{a+b}{2} \text{, } \text{ Var}(X) = \dfrac{(b-a)^2}{12}$$

## Identifying continuous uniform RV from word problems

-   Look for some indication that all events are **equally likely**

    -   Could also say "uniformly distributed"

-   Look for an interval

    -   **Time example:** Costumer in your store will approach the cash register in next 30 minutes. Approaching the register throughout the 30 minutes is equally likely.

    -   **Length example:** You have a 12 inch string that you need to cut. You are equally likely to cut anywhere on the string.

-   Different than the discrete uniform

    -   Discrete usually includes a *countable* number of events that are equally likely

    -   Continuous is not countable

        -   Exact time and length can be measured with infinite decimal places

## Helpful R code

Let's say we're looking at equally likely arrival times between 10 am and 11 am.

-   If we want to know the probability that someone arrives at 10:30am or earlier:

    ```{r}
    #| echo: true
    punif(q = 30, min = 0, max = 60)
    ```

-   If we want to know the time, say $t$, where the probability of arriving at $t$ or earlier is 0.35:

    ```{r}
    #| echo: true
    qunif(p = 0.35, min = 0, max = 60)
    ```

-   If we want to know the probability that someone arrives between 10:14 and 10:16 am:

    ```{r}
    #| echo: true
    punif(q = 16, min = 0, max = 60) - punif(q = 14, min = 0, max = 60)
    ```

-   If we want to sample 20 arrival times from the distribution:

    ```{r}
    #| echo: true
    runif(n = 20, min = 0, max = 60)
    ```

# Chapter 32: Exponential RVs

## Properties of exponential RVs

-   **Scenario:** Modeling the time until the next (first) event

-   Continuous analog to the geometric distribution!

-   Shorthand: $X \sim \text{Exp}(\lambda)$

$$
f_X(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}\text{ for } x>0, \lambda>0
$$

$$
F_X(x) = \left\{
        \begin{array}{ll}
            0 & \quad x<0 \quad \\
            1 - e^{-\lambda x} & \quad x\geq0 \\
        \end{array}
    \right.
$$

$$\text{E}(X) = \dfrac{1}{\lambda}$$ $$\text{Var}(X) = \dfrac{1}{\lambda^2}$$

## Memoryless Property

   

If $b>0$,

$$P(X > a +b | X> a) = P(X > b)$$

     

-   **This can be interpreted as:**

    -   If you have waited $a$ seconds (or any other measure of time) without a success

    -   Then the probability that you have to wait $b$ more seconds is the same as as the probability of waiting $b$ seconds initially.

## Identifying exponential RV from word problems

-   Look for time between events/successes

-   Look for a rate of the events over time period

-   How does it differ from the geometric distribution?

    -   Geometric is *number of trials* until first success

    -   Exponential is *time* until first success

-   Relation to the Poisson distribution?

    -   When the time between arrivals is exponential, the number of arrivals in a fixed time interval is Poisson with the mean $\lambda$

## Helpful R code

Let's say we're sitting at the bus stop, measuring the time until our bus arrives. We know the bus comes every 10 minutes on average.

-   If we want to know the probability that the bus arrives in the next 5 minutes:

    ```{r}
    #| echo: true
    pexp(q = 5, rate = 1/10)
    ```

-   If we want to know the time, say $t$, where the probability of the bus arriving at $t$ or earlier is 0.35:

    ```{r}
    #| echo: true
    qexp(p = 0.35, rate = 1/10)
    ```

-   If we want to know the probability that the bus arrives between 3 and 5 minutes:

    ```{r}
    #| echo: true
    pexp(q = 5, rate = 1/10) - pexp(q = 3, rate = 1/10)
    ```

-   If we want to sample 20 bus arrival times from the distribution:

    ```{r}
    #| echo: true
    rexp(n = 20, rate = 1/10)
    ```

# Chapter 33: Gamma RVs

## Properties of gamma RVs

-   **Scenario:** Modeling the time until the $r^{th}$ event.
-   Continuous analog to the Negative Binomial distribution
-   Shorthand: $X \sim \text{Gamma}(r, \lambda)$

$$
f_X(x) = \dfrac{\lambda^r}{\Gamma(r)}x^{r-1} e^{-\lambda x}\text{ for } x>0, \lambda>0, \Gamma(r) = (r-1)!
$$

$$
F_X(x) = \left\{
        \begin{array}{ll}
            0 & \quad x<0 \quad \\
            1 - e^{-\lambda x}\displaystyle\sum_{j=0}^{r-1}\dfrac{(\lambda x)^j}{j!}  & \quad x\geq0 \\
        \end{array}
    \right.
$$

$$\text{E}(X) = \dfrac{r}{\lambda}\text{, }\text{ Var}(X) = \dfrac{r}{\lambda^2}$$

Common to see $\alpha = r$ and $\beta = \lambda$

## Identifying gamma RV from word problems

-   Gamma distribution with $r=1$ is same as exponential

    -   Just like Negative Binomial with $r=1$ is same as the geometric distribution

-   Similar to exponential

    -   Look for time between or until events/successes
        -   BUT now we are measuring time until more than 1 success
    -   Look for a rate of the events over time period

## Helpful R code

Let's say we're sitting at the bus stop, measuring the time until 4 buses arrive. We know the bus comes every 10 minutes on average.

-   If we want to know the probability that the 4 buses arrive in the next 50 minutes:

::: columns
::: column
```{r}
#| echo: true
pgamma(q = 50, rate = 1/10, shape = 4)
```
:::
::: column
```{r}
#| echo: true
pgamma(q = 50, scale = 10, shape = 4)
```
:::
:::

-   If we want to know the time, say $t$, where the probability of the 4 buses arriving at $t$ or earlier is 0.35:

    ```{r}
    #| echo: true
    qgamma(p = 0.35, rate = 1/10, shape = 4)
    ```

-   If we want to know the probability that the 4 buses arrives between 30 and 50 minutes:

    ```{r}
    #| echo: true
    pgamma(q = 50, scale = 10, shape = 4) - pgamma(q = 30, scale = 10, shape = 4)
    ```

-   If we want to sample 20 arrival times for the 4 buses:

    ```{r}
    #| echo: true
    rgamma(n = 20, scale = 10, shape = 4)
    ```

## Remarks

-   The parameter $r$ in a Gamma($r$,$\lambda$) distribution does NOT need to be a positive integer

    -   $r$ is usually a positive integer

-   When $r$ is a positive integer, the distribution is sometimes called an Erlang($r$,$\lambda$) distribution

     

     

-   When $r$ is any positive real number, we have a general gamma distribution that is usually instead parameterized by $\alpha>0$ and $\beta>0$, where:

    -   $\alpha = \text{shape parameter}$ : same as $k$, the total number of events we must witness

        -   In R code example: 4 buses to wait for

    -   $\beta = \text{scale parameter}$ : same as $\lambda$, the rate parameter

        -   In R code example: 1 bus per 10 minutes (1/10)

# Chapter 35: Normal RVs

## Properties of Normal RVs

-   No scenario description here because the Normal distribution is so universal

      -   Central Limit Theorem (next class) makes it applicable to many types of events

-   Shorthand: $X \sim \text{Normal}(\mu, \sigma^2)$

$$
f_X(x) = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}}e^{-(x-\mu)^2/(2\sigma^2)} \text{, for} -inf < x < inf
$$

$$\text{E}(X) = \mu $$ $$\text{Var}(X) = \sigma^2$$

## Helpful R code

Let's say we're measuring the high temperature today. The average high temperature on this day across many, many years is 50 degrees with a standard deviation of 4 degrees.

-   If we want to know the probability that the high temperature is below 45 degrees:

    ```{r}
    #| echo: true
    pnorm(q = 45, mean = 50, sd = 4)
    ```

-   If we want to know the temoerature, say $t$, where the probability of that the temperature is at $t$ or lower is 0.35:

    ```{r}
    #| echo: true
    qnorm(p = 0.35, mean = 50, sd = 4)
    ```

-   If we want to know the probability that the temperature is between 45 and 50 degrees:

    ```{r}
    #| echo: true
    pnorm(q = 50, mean = 50, sd = 4) - pnorm(q = 45, mean = 50, sd = 4)

    ```

-   If we want to sample 20 days' temperature (over the years) from the distribution:

    ```{r}
    #| echo: true
    rnorm(n = 20, mean = 50, sd = 4)
    ```

## Standard Normal Distribution

$$ Z \sim \text{Normal}(\mu = 0, \sigma^2 = 1)$$

-   Used to be more helpful when computing was not as advanced

    -   Use tables of the standard normal

    -   You can convert any normal distribution to a standard normal through transformation

-   $Z = \dfrac{X - \mu_X}{\sigma_X}$

    -   Comes from $X = \sigma_X Z + \mu_X$

    -   Since $\sigma_X$ and $\mu_X$ are constants, then $E(X) = \mu_X$ and $SD(X) = \sigma_X SD(Z) = \sigma_X$
