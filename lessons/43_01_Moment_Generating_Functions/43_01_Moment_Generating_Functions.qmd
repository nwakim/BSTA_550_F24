## What are moments?

::: definition
::: def-title
Definition 1
:::
::: def-cont
The $j^{th}$ moment of a r.v. $X$ is $\mathbb{E}[X^j]$
:::
:::

::: example
::: ex-title
Example 1
::: 
::: ex-cont
$1^{st}-4^{th}$ moments
:::

## What is a *moment generating function* (mgf)??

::: definition
::: def-title
Definition 3
:::
::: def-cont
If $X$ is a r.v., then the **moment generating function**
(**mgf**) associated with $X$ is:
$$M_X(t)= \mathbb{E}[e^{tX}]$$
:::
:::

**Remarks**

::: columns
::: column
-   For a discrete r.v., the mgf of $X$ is
    $$M_X(t)= \mathbb{E}[e^{tX}]=\sum_{all \ x}e^{tx}p_X(x)$$

-   For a continuous r.v., the mgf of $X$ is
    $$M_X(t)= \mathbb{E}[e^{tX}]=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{tx}f_X(x)dx$$
:::
::: column
-   The mgf $M_X(t)$ is a function of $t$, not of $X$, and it might not
    be defined (i.e. finite) for all values of $t$. We just need it to
    be defined for $t=0$.

What is $M_X(t)$ for $t=0$?

## Theorem 

::: theorem
::: thm-title
Theorem 5
:::
::: thm-cont
The moment generating function uniquely specifies a probability distribution.
:::
:::

::: theorem
::: thm-title
Theorem 6
:::
::: thm-cont
$$\mathbb{E}[X^r] = M_X^{(r)}(0)$$

$(r)$ in this equation is the $r$th derivative with respect to $t$
:::
:::

- When $r=1$, we are taking the first derivative
- When $r=4$, we are taking the fourth derivative

## Using the mgf to uniquely describe a probability distribution

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
::: example
::: ex-title
Example 7
:::
::: ex-cont
Let $X \sim Poisson(\lambda)$

1.  Find the mgf of $X$

2.  Find $\mathbb{E}[X]$

3.  Find $Var(X)$
:::
:::

:::

## Theorem

**Remark:** Finding the mean and variance is sometimes easier with the following
trick

::: theorem
::: thm-title
Theorem 8
:::
::: thm-cont
Let $R_X(t) = \ln[M_X(t)]$. Then, 

$$\mu = \mathbb{E}[X] = R_X'(0) \text{, and}$$
$$\sigma^2 = Var(X) = R_X''(0)$$
:::
:::


::: proof

:::
::: ex-cont
Let $Z$ be a standard normal random variable, i.e.
$Z \sim N(0,1)$.

## Mgf's of sums of independent RV's

::: theorem
::: thm-title
Theorem 9
:::
::: thm-cont
If $X$ and $Y$ are independent RV's with respective mgf's $M_X(t)$ and $M_Y(t)$, then

$$M_{X+Y}(t) = E[e^{t(X+Y)}] = E[e^{tX} e^{tY}] = E[e^{tX}]E[e^{tY}]=M_{X}(t)M_{Y}(t)$$
:::

## Main takeaways

- Mgf's are a purely mathematically definition
  - We can't really relate it to our real world analysis
  
- They are helpful mathematically because they are unique to a probability distribution
  - We can find the unique mgf from for a probability distribution
  - And we can find a distribution from an mgf
  
- Mgf's can *sometimes* make it easier to find the mean and variance of an RV

- Mgf's are most helpful when we are finding a joint distribution that is a sum or transformation of two RV's
  - Make the calculation easier!

- Mgf's are often used to prove certain distribution are sums of other ones!
