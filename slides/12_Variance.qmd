## Learning Objectives

1.  Calculate the variance and standard deviation of discrete random
    variables
2.  Calculate the variance of sums of discrete random variables
3.  Calculate the variance of functions of discrete random variables

## Let's start building the variance through expected values of functions

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
::: example
::: ex-title
Example 1
:::

::: ex-cont
Let $g$ be a function and let $g(x) = ax+b$, for real-valued constants
$a$ and $b$. What is $\mathbb{E}[g(X)]$?
:::
:::
:::
:::

## What is the expected value of a function?

::: definition
::: def-title
Definition: Expected value of function of RV
:::

::: def-cont
For any function $g$ and discrete r.v. $X$, the expected value of $g(X)$
is $$\mathbb{E}[g(X)] = \sum_{\{all\ x\}}\ g(x) p_X(x).$$

## Let's revisit the card example (1/2)

::: columns

::: example
::: ex-title
Example 2
:::

::: ex-cont
Suppose you draw 2 cards from a standard deck of cards *with*
replacement. Let $X$ be the number of hearts you draw.

1.  Find $\mathbb{E}[X^2]$.

## Let's revisit the card example (2/2)

::: ex-title
Example 2
:::

::: ex-cont
Suppose you draw 2 cards from a standard deck of cards *with*
replacement. Let $X$ be the number of hearts you draw.

2.  Find $\mathbb{E}\big[\big(X-\frac{1}{2}\big)^2\big]$.

## Variance of a RV

::: definition
::: def-title
Definition: Variance of RV
:::

::: def-cont
The variance of a r.v. $X$, with (finite) expected value
$\mu_X=\mathbb{E}[X]$ is
$$\sigma_X^2=Var(X)=\mathbb{E}[(X-\mu_X)^2] = \mathbb{E}[(X-\mathbb{E}[X])^2].$$
:::
:::

::: definition
::: def-title
Definition: Standard deviation of RV
:::

::: def-cont
The standard deviation of a r.v. $X$ is
$$\sigma_X = SD(X) = \sqrt{\sigma_X^2}=\sqrt{Var(X)}.$$
:::
:::

## Questions {visibility="hidden"}

**Questions:** Why do we square the difference in the variance
definition? $(X-\mu_X)^2$

-   Why not define the measure of spread as
    $\mathbb{E}[X-\mu_X] = \mathbb{E}[X-\mathbb{E}[X]]$?

-   Why not use $\mathbb{E}[|X-\mu_X|]$?

## Let's calculate the variance and prove it!

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
::: proof1
::: proof-title
Lemma 6: "Computation formula" for Variance
:::

::: proof-cont
The variance of a r.v. $X$, can be computed as $$\begin{align}
\sigma_X^2 & =Var(X) \\ & = \mathbb{E}[X^2]-\mu_X^2 \\ & = \mathbb{E}[X^2] - (\mathbb{E}[X])^2
\end{align}$$

# (break) Some Important Variance and Expected Values Results

## Variance of a function with a single RV

::: proof1
::: proof-title
Lemma 7
:::

::: proof-cont
For a r.v. $X$ and constants $a$ and $b$, $$Var(aX+b) = a^2Var(X).$$
:::
:::

Proof will be exercise in homework. It's fun! In a mathy kinda way.

## Important results for ***independent*** RVs

::: theorem
::: thm-title
Theorem 8
:::

::: thm-cont
For independent r.v.'s $X$ and $Y$, and functions $g$ and $h$,
$$\mathbb{E}[g(X)h(Y)] = \mathbb{E}[g(X)]\mathbb{E}[h(Y)].$$
:::
:::

::: proposition
::: prop-title
Corollary 1
:::

::: prop-cont
For independent r.v.'s $X$ and $Y$,
$$\mathbb{E}[XY] = \mathbb{E}[X]\mathbb{E}[Y].$$
:::
:::

## Variance of sum of independent discrete RVs

::: theorem
::: thm-title
Theorem 9: Variance of sum of independent discrete r.v.'s
:::

::: thm-cont
For independent discrete r.v.'s $X_i$ and constants $a_i$,
$i=1,2,\dots, n$,
$$Var\Bigg(\sum_{i=1}^n a_iX_i\Bigg) = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2Var(X_i).$$
:::
:::

## Corollaries

::: proposition
::: prop-title
Corollary 2
:::

::: prop-cont
For independent discrete r.v.'s $X_i$, $i=1,2,\dots, n$,
$$Var\Bigg(\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\Bigg) = \sum_{i=1}^n Var(X_i).$$
:::
:::

::: proposition
::: prop-title
Corollary 3
:::

::: prop-cont
For independent identically (i.i.d.) discrete r.v.'s $X_i$,
$i=1,2,\dots, n$, $$Var\Bigg(\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\Bigg) = n Var(X_1).$$

## Let's think about our ghost problems again

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
::: example
::: ex-title
Example 3
:::

::: ex-cont
The ghost is trick-or-treating at a different house now. In this case it
is known that the bag of candy has 10 chocolates, 20 lollipops, and 30
laffy taffies. The ghost grabs a handful of five pieces of candy. What
is the variance for the number of chocolates the ghost takes? Let's
solve this for the cases *with* and *without* replacement.

## Back to our hotel example from Chapter 11

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
::: example
::: ex-title
Example 4
:::

::: ex-cont
A tour group is planning a visit to the city of Minneapolis and needs to
book 30 hotel rooms. The average price of a room is \$200 **with
standard deviation \$10**. In addition, there is a 10% tourism tax for
each room. What is the **standard deviation** of the cost for the 30
hotel rooms?
