# Basic Counting Examples

## Basic Counting Examples (1/3)

::: example
::: ex-title
Example 1
:::

::: ex-cont
Suppose we have 10 (distinguishable) subjects for study.

1.  How many possible ways are there to order them?

2.  How many ways to order them if we can reuse the same subject and

    -   need 10 total?

    -   need 6 total?

3.  How many ways to order them if without replacement and only need 6?

4.  How many ways to choose 6 subjects without replacement if the order doesn't matter?

# Permutations and Combinations

## Permutations and Combinations

::: definition
::: def-title
Definition: Permutations
:::

::: def-cont
**Permutations** are the number of ways to **arrange in order** $r$ distinct objects when there are $n$ total.

$$nPr = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$$
:::
:::

::: definition
::: def-title
Definition: Combinations
:::

::: def-cont
**Combinations** are the number of ways to choose (**order doesn't matter**) $r$ objects from $n$ without replacement.

$$nCr = \textrm{"n choose r"} = \binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$$
:::
:::

## Some combinations properties

-   $$\binom{n}{r} = \binom{n}{n-r}$$

     

     

-   $$\binom{n}{1} = n$$

     

     

-   $$\binom{n}{0} = 1$$

# More Examples: order matters vs. not

Example 2
:::

::: ex-cont
Suppose we draw 2 cards from a standard deck without replacement. What is the probability that both are spades when

1.  order matters?
2.  order doesn't matter?

## Table of different cases

See table on pg. 277 of textbook

-   $n$ = total number of objects

-   $r$ = number objects needed

    |                          |   with replacement    |             without replacement              |
    |-------------------:|:----------------------:|:--------------------------:|
    |        **order matters** |        $$n^r$$        |         $$nPr = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$$          |
    | **order doesn't matter** | $$ \binom{n+r-1}{r}$$ | $$nCr = \binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$$ |
