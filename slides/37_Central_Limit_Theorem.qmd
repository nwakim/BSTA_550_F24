## The Central Limit Theorem

::: theorem
::: thm-title
Theorem 1: Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
:::
::: thm-cont
Let $X_i$ be iid rv's
with common mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$, for $i=1,2,\ldots,n$.
Then $$\sum_{i=1}^n X_i \rightarrow \text{N}(n\mu, n\sigma^2)$$

Corollary 1
:::
::: prop-cont
Let $X_i$ be iid rv's with common mean $\mu$ and
variance $\sigma^2$, for $i=1,2,\ldots,n$. Then
$$\bar{X}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n X_i}{n}  \rightarrow \text{N}\Bigg(\mu, \dfrac{\sigma^2}{n}\Bigg)$$

According to a large US study, the mean resting heart
rate of adult women is about 74 beats per minutes (bpm), with standard
deviation 13 bpm (NHANES 2003-2004).

1.  Find the probability that the average resting heart rate for a
    random sample of 36 adult women is more than 3 bpm away from the
    mean.

2.  Repeat the previous question for a single adult woman.

## CLT for Discrete RVs

1.  **Binomial rv's**: Let $X \sim Bin(n,p)$.

2.  **Poisson rv's**: Let $X \sim Poisson(\lambda)$.

Example 3

::: ex-cont
Suppose that the probability of developing a specific
type of breast cancer in women aged 40-49 is 0.001. Assume the
occurrences of cancer are independent. Suppose you have data from a
random sample of 20,000 women aged 40-49.

1.  How many of the 20,000 women would you expect to develop this type
    of breast cancer, and what is the standard deviation?

2.  Find the **exact** probability that more than 15 of the 20,000
    women will develop this type of breast cancer.

3.  Use the CLT to find the **approximate** probability that more than
    15 of the 20,000 women will develop this type of breast cancer.

4.  Use the CLT to approximate the following probabilities, where $X$
    is the number of women that will develop this type of breast
    cancer.

    a.  $\mathbb{P}(15 \leq X \leq 22)$

    b.  $\mathbb{P}(X > 20)$

    c.  $\mathbb{P}(X < 20)$

5.  Find the **approximate** probability that more than 15 of the
    20,000 women will develop this type of breast cancer - not using the
    CLT!

6.  Use the CLT to approximate the approximate probability in the
    previous question!
