::: g-col-8
Dr. Buolamwini earned a BS in Computer Science from Georgia Institute of Technology, an Master's from University of Oxford, and MS and PhD (2022) degrees in Media Arts & Sciences from Massachusetts Institute of Technology. While a graduate student, Dr. Buolamwini was part of the <a href = "https://www.media.mit.edu/" target = "_blank">MIT Media Lab</a>. Additionally, she is the founder of the <a href = "https://www.ajl.org/" target = "_blank">Algorithmic Justice League</a>.

#### Topics covered

Dr. Buolamwini has done substantial work demonstrating how algorithms can encode bias. Her undergraduate senior project was to create a inspired "mask" mirror as a way to raise spirits for the person who looked into the mirror. The project relied on off the shelf facial recognition software that could not recognize Dr. Buolamwini's face.

Since then, she has focused her work on demonstrating bias across racial and gender spectra in off the shelf software. Her work has been <a href = "https://www.biometricupdate.com/202003/tech-giants-pressured-to-follow-google-in-removing-gender-labels-from-computer-vision-services" target = "_blank">cited</a> as directly influencing Microsoft and Google's changes to their algorithms.

Among many other aspects, a big focus of Dr. Buolamwini's work is pointing out the biased data which directly impacts how algorithms learn how to do tasks.

#### Other

Dr. Buolamwini has done a lot of work on how data propagates through systems to encode the same types of bias into different algorithms. In her video <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxuyfWoVV98" target = "_blank">AI, Ain't I a Woman?</a> she demonstrates how systems designed to determine gender are particularly poor when using dark skinned faces.

Her work was featured in a recent documentary <a href = "https://www.codedbias.com/" target = "_blank">Coded Bias</a>.

## Muddiest Points

### 2. How does this link to more real life applications? Isn't this the same as the previous chapters, but with new notation?

We'll see a better application in homework 4 (but don't worry, it won't be overly complicated).

So far, yes, the joint distribution we have done with discrete random variables have been very similar to the examples with events A and B. This is mostly meant to guide us through some of the new and difficult notation. You can think of our work so far with pmf's and CDFs as a way to rewrite and reframe the previous problems we have looked at. This reframing is going to help us when we start looking at continuous random variables.

### 3. Notation is hard to get down!

#### What is F? Is it a function?

Yes, it is! It is the function: $$F_X(x) = \mathbb{P}(X \leq x)$$

The CDF stands for cumulative distribution function, which we write in math terms as $F_X(x)$. The CDF is the probability that $X$ will take a value less than or equal to $x$. Just like the pmf, the sample space is defined by $X$, but the range of values that $F$ maps to is 0 to 1, and is increasing as $x$ increases.

#### What's an RV and what's the value that an RV takes on?

Here's what I wrote in Week 3 Muddy Points:

-   What's the difference between $X(\omega)$ (random variable) and $x$ (the value of the random varaible)?

    -   In class we defined $X(\omega) = x$. We call $X(\omega)$ or $X$ the random variable and $x$ the realized value of that random variable.

    -   For example: If I roll 20 dice, what is the number of dice that come up with 6?

        -   $X$ (or $X(\omega)$) is the number of 6's that come up

        -   $x$ is the realized value (like 4 dice have 6's) that can be observed

        -   The number of 6's ($X$ or $X(\omega)$) is not yet a realized value, but it can be any of the realized values, $x$! Thus, we write $X = x$.

    -   I thought [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/4ti8nm/what_is_the_difference_between_x_and_x_in_regards/) is pretty helpful!

#### pmf vs. CDF: takes practice to remember the difference

For this, I'd say practice helps the most to distinguish between them.

I really suggest that you do this kind of table for all the different probabilities that we've identified so far:

-   $p_{X,Y}(x,y)$

-   $F_{X,Y}(x,y)$

-   $p_{X|Y}(x|y)$

-   $F_{X|Y}(x|y)$

### 4. For the drawing $200$ cards example: why $x = 0, 1, 2, ..., 200$ but $i = 1, 2, 3, ...,200$ instead of $201$? Doesn't that mean we're summing over a shorter interval?

Yes! The interval that we sum over will be 1 to 200, but this will still cover all the x values from 0 to 200. When we sum over $i=1, 2, 3, …, 200$ draws, if all 200 the draws (all $Y_i$'s) come up with cards that are not hearts, then the sum is 0 ($\sum_{i=1}^{200} Y_i = 0$). Thus, $x$ can still take on a 0 value.

### 5. I got a little tripped up on what $a_i$ means in theorem 11.1: sum of discrete RVs. Wouldn't it just be an $a$? Or is it $a_i$ because it's a different constant (the probability?) for each $X_i$?

It would not be $a$ (without the $i$). It *is* because $a_i$ represents a different constant for each $X_i$! So you are right! However, $a_i$ is not a probability. This is where the expected value gets a little confusing with all the sums. The expected value of a single random variable is defined by $E[X_1] = \sum_{j=1}^{m} x_j p_{X_1}(x_j)$, where $m$ is the total number of values $X_1$ can take and $j$ is the $jth$ value of $X_1$. Then if we want to look at the expected value of the sum of $X_1$ and $X_2$, We look at $E\bigg[\sum_{i=1}^{2} X_i\bigg] =E[X_1 + X_2] =E[X_1] + E[X_2]=\sum_{j=1}^{m} x_j p_{X_1}(x_j) + \sum_{k=1}^{h} x_k p_{X_2}(x_k)$. If we then wanted to look at the expected value of the sum of $3\times X_1$ and $2 \times X_2$, we could write: $E\bigg[\sum_{i=1}^{2} a_i X_i\bigg] =E[3X_1 + 2X_2] =E[3X_1] + E[2X_2]=3E[X_1] + 2E[X_2]= 3\sum_{j=1}^{m} x_j p_{X_1}(x_j) + 2\sum_{k=1}^{h} x_k p_{X_2}(x_k)$

### 6. Expected value for our examples with and without replacement (and then also with finite and infinite draws)

Working on a better explanation for this one!

### 7. For corollary 11.1.2, when it says the random variables are identically distributed, does that also mean the random variables must be independent as well?

No! So this is a special property of expected values called the *linearity of expected values*. It means that no matter if the random variables are dependent, the expected value of the sum (of RVs) is the sum of the expected values of RVs. So when the random variables are identically distributed, the expected value of each is the same. Hence, the corollary. The fact that they are dependent does not change the corollary!
