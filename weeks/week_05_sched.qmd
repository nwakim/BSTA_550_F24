### Exam info

Below are my current instructions for the exam. Are there any questions?

> #### Instructions
>
> 1.  I have written a "45 minute" exam. However, you have the full class period from 10:35am - 12pm.
>
> 2.  The exam is open book and open notes. You may use books other than the class textbook, you may anything on our course webpage, and you may use reference websites (like Wikipedia, Googling expected value of specific distribution, etc.).
>
> 3.  No cheating will be tolerated. This includes:
>
>     -   Using ChatGPT
>
>     -   Using question and answer threads typically seen on sites like StackExchange, WikiHow, Quora, Reddit, StackOverflow, Chegg, etc.
>
>     -   Asking other students in the room or looking at other students' exam work.
>
> 4.  You must show work to receive full credit. If you have a correct answer, but no work, you may not receive full credit. "Work" can include:
>
>     -   Writing your internal narrative for why you made a certain calculation
>
>     -   Writing where you got a number from
>
>     -   Writing the formula for something you calculate
>
>     -   Writing the property that you used to get from one step to another

## Statistician of the Week: Liz Hare

```{r fig.cap = "Liz Hare", fig.alt = "Image credit: ", preview = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/stat_of_week/hare.jpg")
```
:::

::: g-col-8
Dr. Hare got her BA from Bryn Mawr College and her PhD in Genetics (1998) from The George Washington University. She works primarily in dog / animal genetics; although, as a quantitative geneticist her statistical and computational methodology is quite sophisticated.

Dr. Hare is active in the <a href = "https://mircommunity.com/about/" target = "_blank">MiR (Minorities in R) Community</a> which aims to support historically underrepresented R users around the world.

#### Topics covered

Her computational language of choice is `R`, and much of her work has focused on open science with an eye toward inclusion and equity. In many software programs, the user has the ability to include **alt text**: text descriptions that convey the content and meaning to blind and low-vision readers.

> you really need to tell us what the data is saying and why you included it.

1.  What kind of graph or chart is it?
2.  What variables are on the axes?
3.  What are the ranges of the variables?
4.  What does the appearance tell you about the relationships between the variables?
