## Additional Information

### Announcements 11/20

-   **No office hours this week!!**
-   HW 4 feedback
    -   In NTB 1

        -   Did not check all your numbers

        -   Try to use variable name (like highest education level) when describing what the probabilities mean

    -   NTB 4

        -   Please relate this back to the hypergeometric distribution and see that each cashew drawn is not independent, but we get the same expected value as a binomial

        -   As property of hypergeometric distribution (without replacement): expected value is the same as binomial (with replacement).
-   Final exam will **not** be cumulative
    -   Will only cover Chapter 24 and on
-   Student access to Vanport
    -   5/6th floors: 7:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m all days

## Statistician of the Week: Mike Dairyko

::: g-col-8
Dr. Dairyko was a Posse Scholar at Pomona College where a linear algebra class set him on a career path centered around mathematics. Through that class he found his way to two different summer REU programs and eventually to a PhD in Applied Mathematics from Iowa State University (2018). While initially believing that he would stay in academia after his graduate work, being introduced to machine learning methods caused him to pursue data science jobs after graduation.

Dr. Dairyko served as a Senior Manager of Data Science at the Milwaukee Brewers and is now the Director of Ticketing Analytics at the Milwaukee Bucks. Helping the organization get the most out of budgeting, revenue, and ticket sales allows him to fully use his training in mathematics and data science.

#### Topics covered

Dr. Dairyko's graduate work is in graph theory, in particular, exponential domination. In a graph, exponential domination is the extent to which a particular vertex influences the remaining vertices in a graph. His published work falls very much within the realm of mathematics, proving that particular properties of graphs exist. However, graph theory is intimately related to machine learning; for example, it is the foundational structure of a neural network. Understanding properties of graphs help data scientists develop even more powerful models to harness information from data.
