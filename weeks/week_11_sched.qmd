### Exam Materials

-   Practice material

    -   [Review questions](/weeks/week_10/Final_review_questions.pdf)

        -   Questions highlighted are what I deem helpful review for our test
        -   [Review answers](/weeks/week_10/Final_review_answers.pdf)

    -   Practice problems in HW 6-7

    -   Unfinished examples from class notes

    -   [Review notes from class](/slides_annotated/Final%20review.pdf)

        -   There is an extra practice problem (32.10) in there that is *very helpful*

        -   [With video](https://ohsuitg-my.sharepoint.com/personal/wakim_ohsu_edu/_layouts/15/stream.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fwakim%5Fohsu%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2FTeaching%2FClasses%2FF2023%5FBSTA%5F550%2FRecordings%2F38%5FFinal%5Freview%2Emp4&referrer=StreamWebApp%2EWeb&referrerScenario=AddressBarCopied%2Eview)

-   Will NOT be cumulative: Chapter 24 - Chapter 35

    -   Chapter 31 - 35: Test will use distributions that we learn but will not be asking word problems

        -   Think Example 1 from Chapter 32 notes: Tests more on joint pdf than exponential distribution

    -   Weeks 7 - 9, with some from Week 10

    -   HW 6-7

    -   There will NOT be a question using a transformation of X and Y. For example, a question like HW 7, NTB #3 will NOT be on the test.

        -   However, a question like 32.10 will be on the test. In that question we are asked about $P(X<Y)$

-   Will be formatted the same as the midterm!!

    -   45 minute test with full class time to finish

    -   I will give you the distribution information that we learned

        -   pdf, CDF (if given previously), $E(X)$, $Var(X)$

    -   

## On the Horizon

## End of quarter feedback!

## Additional Information

## Statistician of the Week: Maricela Cruz

::: g-col-8
Dr. Cruz did her undergraduate work at Pomona College, majoring in mathematics. Her PhD in Statistics is from University of California, Irvine. She is now Assistant Biostatistics Investigator, Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute (KPWHRI) and Affiliate Assistant Investigator, Department of Biostatistics, University of Washington.

In an <a href = "https://www.lathisms.org/calendar-2022s/maricela-cruz" target = "_blank">interview done by Lathisms</a>, Dr. Cruz reminds us:

> Navigating institutions that have systematically excluded groups of people can be taxing, especially for people from one or more of these groups. Surround yourself with those who believe in you, give you the space to ask 'silly' questions, value your input, and/or understand your struggles. Do activities that will help you blow off steam. No one person or activity will meet all your support needs, so find the right group and balance for you.

#### Topics covered

Dr. Cruz's dissertation work was on interrupted time series models used to determine intervention timing. Indeed, her primary research questions are to understand complex health interventions. At KPWHRI she has continued to work on epidemiological methods, particularly those appropriate for longitudinal and multilevel data.
